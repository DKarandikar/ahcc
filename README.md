# C Compiler

This is an attempt to kill 4 birds with one stone: learning something about Haskell, compilers, the C language and assembly at once.

The tutorial series on the symbolic calculator avaiable at https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/user/school/starting-with-haskell/basics-of-haskell is being used to learn somethign about Haskell and compilers.

The tutorial series at https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html is being used to apply this to a real C compiler.
